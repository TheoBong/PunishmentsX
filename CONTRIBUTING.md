#### Pull Requests
If you make any changes or improvements to the plugin which you think would be beneficial to others, please consider making a pull request to merge your changes back into the upstream project. (especially if your changes are bug fixes!)

PunishmentsX loosely follows the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). Generally, try to copy the style of code found in the class you're editing. 

Please make sure to have bug fixes/improvements in seperate pull requests from new features/changing how features work.
